Title: Our Data Sources and Partners

Barcelona Dust Forecast Center

    Who they are: World Meteorological Organization's designated regional center for dust forecasting

    What they provide: Multi-model ensemble forecasts for dust concentration

    Coverage: Middle East and North Africa region

    Update frequency: Daily forecasts for up to 3 days ahead

Multi-Model Analysis
We combine data from:

    NMMB/BSC-Dust Model - Barcelona Supercomputing Center

    DREAM Model - NOAA/NESDIS

    MONARCH Model - Barcelona Supercomputing Center

    GEMS Model - Korean Meteorological Administration

This ensemble approach gives us:

    More accurate predictions

    Better uncertainty estimates

    Reduces individual model biases

NASA Contributions

    MODIS satellite data for validation

    CALIPSO vertical dust profiles

    MERRA-2 reanalysis data

Why Multiple Sources Matter

    No single model is perfect

    Ensemble means better accuracy

    Reduces risk of missing events

    Provides confidence in forecasts

    Title: How We Calculate Iraq's Air Quality

Data Collection
We gather dust concentration data from multiple sources:

    Barcelona Dust Forecast Center - Primary source

    NASA Satellite Data - Validation and backup

    Regional Weather Stations - Ground truthing

PM10 to AQI Conversion
We use the US EPA's AQI formula for PM10:

    Good (0-50): 0-54 µg/m³

    Moderate (51-100): 55-154 µg/m³

    Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): 155-254 µg/m³

    Unhealthy (151-200): 255-354 µg/m³

    Very Unhealthy (201-300): 355-424 µg/m³

    Hazardous (301-500): 425+ µg/m³

Interpolation Method (IDW)
We use Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to estimate values at unmeasured locations:

    Nearby stations have more influence

    Distance weighting ensures smooth transitions

    Provides complete coverage for all Iraqi districts

Quality Control

    Automated error checking

    Manual verification of extreme values

    Cross-validation with multiple data sources

    Regular calibration checks
